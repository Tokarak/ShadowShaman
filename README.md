# shadowshaman
the noob proof debian/ubuntu socks/proxy/vpn server spawner afap. make sure the port is open and free or else it wont start. working on most debian/ubuntu. if it didn't start for the first time because you chose the wrong port, just run the script again with a new port.

```
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aymjnd/shadowshaman/master/shadowshaman.sh
sudo chmod +x shadowshaman.sh
./shadowshaman.sh
```

get your client [here](https://shadowsocks.org/en/download/clients.html) or find it yourself!
